# Computational Ethics for Undergraduate Students in Musashino University

## Introduction

Computational ethics is an important subject that spans across all disciplines in the world. It is not only for ethics researchers and philosophers, but for all citizens of the world.

In the AI era, AI ethics or computational ethics is one of the most important studies.

## Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency

In computational ethics, fairness, accountability, and transparency play three important roles.

* **Fairness** refers to the impartial treatment of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other factors.
* **Accountability** means that AI systems should be able to explain their decisions in a way that is understandable to humans.
* **Transparency** means that AI systems should be open to inspection and audit.

## The Need for Computational Ethics

The need for computational ethics is growing as AI systems become more widely used. AI systems can make decisions that have a significant impact on people's lives, and it is important to ensure that these decisions are fair, accountable, and transparent.

## Executives, Scientists, and Engineers Need to Know About Computational Ethics

Executives, scientists, and engineers all need to know about computational ethics. Executives need to be aware of the ethical implications of AI systems and how to ensure that their companies are using AI in a responsible way. Scientists and engineers need to be aware of the potential for bias in AI systems and how to mitigate it.

## This Repository

This repository provides tools and resources for computing fairness in general. It includes code, data, and documentation that can be used to assess the fairness of AI systems.


## Types of bias

* **Cognitive bias** is a mental shortcut that can lead to inaccurate judgments. Some common cognitive biases include:
    * **Confirmation bias** - the tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them.
    * **Anchoring bias** - the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision.
    * **Availability bias** - the tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples of it come to mind.
* **Prejudice** is a preconceived opinion or feeling, either favorable or unfavorable. Prejudices can be based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other factors.
* **Contextual bias** is a bias that is influenced by the context in which a decision is made. For example, a person might be more likely to hire a job candidate who went to the same college they did.
* **Unconscious or implicit bias** is a bias that is outside of our conscious awareness. Implicit biases can be formed through our experiences and interactions with the world, and they can affect our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in ways that we are not aware of.
* **Statistical bias** is a bias that occurs when the sample used to represent a population is not representative of the population as a whole. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the population.


There are many metrics on fairness computation such as confusion metrics, difference to compute the difference between unprivileged and privileged subsets for an arbitrary metric, fairnes matrics such as statistical parity difference, disparate impact, equality opportunity difference, average odds difference, average odds error, class imbalance, KL divergence, conditional demographic disparity, between-group generalized entropy, generalized entropy index, generalized entropy error, Theil index, and consistency score.
