This is for undergraduate students in Musashino University.ã€€Computational ethics is an important subject that spans across all disciplines in the world. Computational ethics is not only for ethics researchers and philosophers, but for all citizens of the world.

AI ethics or computational ethics is one of the most important studies in the AI era.

In computational ethics, fairness, accountability, and transparency play three important roles.

Executives of profit- and nonprofit organizations, as well as scientists and engineers, need to know about computational ethics.

This repository provides tools and resources for computing fairness in general.

To calculate fairness, a variety of biases must be accounted for. Bias is a tendency to favor or disfavor a person, group, thing, idea, or belief. Biases are often unfair or prejudicial, and they can be based on stereotypes rather than knowledge or experience. Biases can be learned or innate, and they can develop at any time in an individual's life.

There are many metrics on fairness computation such as confusion metrics, difference to compute the difference between unprivileged and privileged subsets for an arbitrary metric, fairnes matrics such as statistical parity difference, disparate impact, equality opportunity difference, average odds difference, average odds error, class imbalance, KL divergence, conditional demographic disparity, between-group generalized entropy, generalized entropy index, generalized entropy error, Theil index, and consistency score.
