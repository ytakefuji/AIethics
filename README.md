This is for undergraduate students in Musashino University.ã€€Computational ethics is an important subject that spans across all disciplines in the world. Computational ethics is not only for ethics researchers and philosophers, but for all citizens of the world.

AI ethics or computational ethics is one of the most important studies in the AI era.

In computational ethics, fairness, accountability, and transparency play three important roles.

Executives of profit- and nonprofit organizations, as well as scientists and engineers, need to know about computational ethics.

This repository provides tools and resources for computing fairness in general.

To calculate fairness, a variety of biases must be accounted for. Bias is a tendency to favor or disfavor a person, group, thing, idea, or belief. Biases are often unfair or prejudicial, and they can be based on stereotypes rather than knowledge or experience. Biases can be learned or innate, and they can develop at any time in an individual's life.

There are many types of bias: cognitive bias, prejudices, contextual bias, unconscious or implicit bias, statistical bias and others. 

Cognitive bias is a mental shortcut that can lead to inaccurate judgments. Some common cognitive biases include:

Confirmation bias - the tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them.

Anchoring bias - the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision.

Availability bias - the tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples of it come to mind.


Prejudice is a preconceived opinion or feeling, either favorable or unfavorable. Prejudices can be based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other factors.

Contextual bias is a bias that is influenced by the context in which a decision is made. For example, a person might be more likely to hire a job candidate who went to the same college they did.

Unconscious or implicit bias is a bias that is outside of our conscious awareness. Implicit biases can be formed through our experiences and interactions with the world, and they can affect our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in ways that we are not aware of.

Statistical bias is a bias that occurs when the sample used to represent a population is not representative of the population as a whole. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the population.
How to reduce bias


There are many metrics on fairness computation such as confusion metrics, difference to compute the difference between unprivileged and privileged subsets for an arbitrary metric, fairnes matrics such as statistical parity difference, disparate impact, equality opportunity difference, average odds difference, average odds error, class imbalance, KL divergence, conditional demographic disparity, between-group generalized entropy, generalized entropy index, generalized entropy error, Theil index, and consistency score.
